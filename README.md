## Build

Not sure why you'd want to build from source, but you can if you want. Requires
the `pdflatex` and `latexmk` tools found in `texlive-full`. With dependencies
installed, run `npm run build` to build the PDF, or `npm start` to build, clean,
and open it.

Feel free to reference it or fork it if you'd like.
